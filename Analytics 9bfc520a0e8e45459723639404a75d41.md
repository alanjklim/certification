# Analytics

### **1. Amazon Athena**

### **Primary Functions:**

- **Amazon Athena** is a serverless, interactive query service that allows you to analyze data directly in **Amazon S3** using **standard SQL**.
- It works directly with data stored in various formats, such as **CSV**, **JSON**, **Parquet**, and **ORC**.

### **When to Use:**

- **Ad-hoc querying**: Use Athena when you need to quickly query large datasets stored in S3 without needing to set up complex infrastructure.
- **Serverless analytics**: Ideal for scenarios where you want to run queries without managing servers.

### **Antipatterns:**

- Avoid using Athena for continuous, low-latency analytics. It is better suited for **batch querying** than real-time data processing.

### **2. Amazon EMR**

### **Primary Functions:**

- **Amazon EMR (Elastic MapReduce)** is a cloud big data platform for processing vast amounts of data using **Apache Hadoop**, **Apache Spark**, and other big data frameworks.

### **When to Use:**

- Use EMR for **distributed processing** of large datasets across scalable clusters, especially for **ETL jobs**, **machine learning**, and **big data analytics**.

### **Antipatterns:**

- Avoid EMR for small-scale data processing as it may be overkill for basic data tasks. It can be costly if not properly managed.

### **3. AWS Glue**

### **Primary Functions:**

- **AWS Glue** is a fully managed ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) service that automates data preparation for analytics.
- It integrates with a variety of AWS services and can catalog, clean, and transform data stored in **S3**, **RDS**, **Redshift**, and more.

### **When to Use:**

- Use Glue for **serverless ETL** operations and to **prepare data** for machine learning or analytics.
- Glue is also used to create a **Data Catalog** to organize and manage metadata.

### **Antipatterns:**

- Avoid Glue for small, real-time transformations where the startup time of Glue jobs can lead to inefficiencies.

### **5. AWS Lake Formation**

### **Primary Functions:**

- **AWS Lake Formation** simplifies the process of building, securing, and managing a **data lake** in Amazon S3.
- It helps you ingest, catalog, cleanse, and transform data while managing access control policies for your lake.

### **When to Use:**

- Use Lake Formation when building a **secure, governed data lake** in AWS, where multiple teams and users need different levels of access to datasets.

### **Antipatterns:**

- Avoid using Lake Formation for temporary, small datasets that do not require centralized data governance.

### **Mermaid Diagram: AWS Lake Formation Workflow**

### **6. Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose**

### **Primary Functions:**

- **Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose** is a real-time data streaming service that loads streaming data into **S3**, **Redshift**, **Elasticsearch**, and other services.

### **When to Use:**

- Use Kinesis Data Firehose for **real-time data delivery**, such as streaming logs from applications or IoT devices into AWS for analytics.

### **Antipatterns:**

- Avoid using Firehose when your application doesnâ€™t require real-time data ingestion or where batch processing is sufficient.

### **Mermaid Diagram: Kinesis Data Firehose Workflow**
